Project 1: Token Registration via Link - HTML, CSS, and JS

Welcome to the Token Registration project! This project allows users to register by saving a token from a provided link locally using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How it Works:

Token Extraction:
When the user opens the provided link, the JavaScript code extracts the token from the URL parameters.
Local Storage:
The extracted token is then saved locally using the browser's local storage feature.
Registration Confirmation:
Upon successful token extraction and storage, the user is considered registered.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Provides the structure and layout for the registration page.
CSS: Styles the registration page for a visually appealing user experience.
JavaScript: Handles token extraction from the URL and local storage operations.
How to Use:

Open the Registration Link:
Access the provided registration link.
Token Extraction:
JavaScript will automatically extract the token from the URL.
Local Storage:
The token will be stored locally in the browser's storage.
Registration Confirmation:
You are now registered! The token is saved locally for future use.
Feel free to explore the codebase and customize it according to your needs!
